OSCAR: There you have it everyone, THE FINALS Major event coming 2025, $100,000 in the prize pool.
Can you believe it, Luke? We're here, we made it all the way here.
That's it, I'm gonna say it one more time so it's actually loud and clear.
Get your teams together, get ready for 2025, we're blowing the cap out of this place.
We're doing $100,000 in prize money for a Major event during 2025.
Any comments?
THiiXY: As someone who has been following this game for a long time, I've nearly been playing this game for two years now.
One of the things that's thrown in the air is, ah, can THE FINALS be an esport, can THE FIN- are Embark gonna actually do it.
We are doing it. The game is doing well, we are doing strong, and we are here to commit that back to you and the player base.
But YOU have to prove yourself right here under the floodlights of the arenas in THE FINALS.
You're gonna be contested up against a lot of other people around the world, as well, for that $100,000 prize pool.
OSCAR: We are- we have spent the last year making THE FINALS into the best game it can be alongside all of you, our wonderful players,
taken into account all your feedback, and wisdom, and today we are proud to say the game is the best it has ever been.
And, it just keeps getting better. And for the first time, we are ready to get onto that road to esports, which is something
we are going to be figuring out in 2025.
But I'm here right now to tell you that we have made a commitment, we are going to be here all of next year, and there is $100,000 in a prize pool
coming sometime in 2025.
