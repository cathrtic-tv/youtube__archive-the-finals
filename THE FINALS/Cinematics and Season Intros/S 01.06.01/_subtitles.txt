SCOTTY: It's lights out in the arena, from all of us here at THE FINALS, thanks for watching.

JUNE [offline]: And we're out!
SCOTTY: Time for an OSPUZE Pro Juice!
JUNE: You actually drink those?
SCOTTY: Wouldn't want Sofia to hear you say that.
JUNE: Oh, she has enough on her plate with the recent hacks.
Trust me.
SCOTTY: They're not hacks, June, they're glitches.
Besides HOLTOW's not worried.
JUNE: They don't run the show, they just sponsor it.
Someone put those messages in the system.
SCOTTY: Ah, you worry too much.
JUNE: You keep telling yourself that, Scotty.
The writing's on the wall... Literally.
