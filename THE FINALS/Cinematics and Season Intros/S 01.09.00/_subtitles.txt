SCOTTY [online]: When the coins get tough, The Tough Shells get coins!
What a win!
On behalf of our sponsors, thanks for tuning in!

SCOTTY [offline]: And that's a wrap!
JUNE: Another broadcast, and another message from CNS.
SCOTTY: They're starting to draw attention away from the contestants.
JUNE: Hmm. The messages tend to appear at the big matches.
It's certainly not random.
SCOTTY: I mean... I guess it could be a publicity stunt.
JUNE: That would explain why VOLPE's tech hasn't blocked them.
But, what if it's not a stunt?
SCOTTY: All i know is that whatever CNS is, it can't outsmart THE FINALS.
JUNE: True enough.
And if CNS wanted to earn real fame, they'd need to compete.
Just like you, Scotty.
