JUNE: Welcome to Season 2 of THE FINALS!
Last season, our contestants competed for fame, fortune and glory!
SCOTTY: It was jam-packed with action and events!
We had a snowball fight, a heavy showdown in Steal the Spotlight.
JUNE: And duked it out in old west Monaco!
SCOTTY: I wonder what's in store for Season 2?

JUNE: Well, for starters - private matches where contestants
get the arena all to themselves!
SCOTTY: We're also trying a revamped league system
based on individual skill for better matches in our ranked tournaments!
JUNE: And a new mode!
SCOTTY: That's right! It's a 5v5 scuffle!
JUNE: In Power Shift, our contestants will fight to control a platform
as it smashes its way through the arena!
SCOTTY: Another highlight for this season is our brand-new career circuits
featuring sponsor contracts and unique rewards.
Brought to you by our seasonal sponsors,
including cyber-security experts: VAIIYA.
JUNE: Are you messing with the stream?
SCOTTY: Seems to be- (cutting out)

CNS: Are you ready...
... for something else?
We are CNS.
And we are here to change the game.

SCOTTY: Well... erhm...
Apologies for the technical difficulties, folks.
Further proof that anything can happen in THE FINALS.
JUNE: Moving right along! We're introducing new weapons
and show-stopping gadgets and abilities!
SCOTTY: And the Battle Pass is overloaded with prizes.
JUNE: Get ready, get set... get in there contestants!
Season 2 of THE FINALS starts NOW!
