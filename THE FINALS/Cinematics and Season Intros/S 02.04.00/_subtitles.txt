SCOTTY [online]: Congratulations to The Big Splash, who made big waves with their winning strategy.
We'll see you next time at THE FINALS!

SCOTTY [offline]: All right, we're out.
Trying to commentate in that CNS arena is driving me nuts.
JUNE: Yeah, but our ratings are up, and the viewers seem to be responding to CNS.
SCOTTY: Well, we're playing in their digital playground now,
and we're clueless about their end goal.
JUNE: Sounds like you don't like the idea of a little change.
SCOTTY: A little change? They said they're here to change the game.
A new arena and a bunch of new equipment? Who knows what's next?
JUNE: Eventually, VAIIYA will isolate the attack and secure the show.
They won't let this go on forever.
SCOTTY: I don't know. If VOLPE's tech let them in, can VAIIYA really kick them out?
