SCOTTY: Introducing season 3!
Wait June, weren't we supposed to be back in the usual Arenas after the reboot?
JUNE: Is that a samurai over there?
I mean, we expected Kyoto, but this is not the 22nd-century version.
Maybe it's from the AI, shall we jump in?
SCOTTY: Yep, let's go.

SCOTTY: Here we go, contestants.
Terminal Attack is back, and it looks like it's here to stay.
JUNE: Plus, all rank play has changed.
Contestants will now be playing Terminal Attack to rise through the leagues.
SCOTTY: There's also a new World Tour on the books.
It's a series of limited-time tournaments and events scheduled throughout the season.
JUNE: Not to mention some new weapons and a new specialization that'll mix things up.
SCOTTY: And, the battle pass is overloaded with prizes.
JUNE: Get ready, get set, get in there, contestants. 
Season 3 of THE FINALS starts now!
