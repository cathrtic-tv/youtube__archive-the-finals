SCOTTY: An electrifying performance from The Live Wires! What a win!
And now a word from one of our sponsors.

HOLTOW: The life giver. The sun.
Always on. The source of everything that is good.
But, can it be trusted?
HOLTOW's Sun Insurance will have you covered if the unimaginable happens,
and the light goes out.
HOLTOW. Brighter than ever.

SCOTTY: All right, we're clear. June, what's up? You seem distracted today.
JUNE: It's just... I heard Marcel from Corporate has shown up here.
SCOTTY: Wha--?! Marcel from MultiCo? You mean Merciless Marcel?
JUNE: The one and only.
SCOTTY: Oh boy.
Well, after everything we've been through with CNS and the reboot, I'm not really surprised.
JUNE: Rumor has it that he had a meeting with the sponsors this morning.
Things are definitely going to change around here. Again.
SCOTTY: Good! And let's hope they take CNS and its game mode out of the spotlight.
JUNE: Said like a true spokesperson for OSPUZE.
SCOTTY: Hey, it's the best drink in the world.
