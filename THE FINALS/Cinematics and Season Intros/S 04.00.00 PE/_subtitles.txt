JUNE: MultiCo is proud to present Season 4 of THE FINALS!
SCOTTY: Our sponsors have stepped up like never before, for our viewers and our contestants.
JUNE: First, thanks to ENGIMO, we're bringing our viewers an exciting programming change.
SCOTTY: That's right! We've got new cashout tournaments for our ranked play!
JUNE: Updated rules include new respawn times for defenders and even more cash for eliminations.
SCOTTY: With out higher-ranked teams scattered throughout the bracket, it's going to be competitive,
but there's always a chance for a thrilling upset.
Let's hear it for ENGIMO! Beyond boundaries; within reach.

SCOTTY: And that's not all! Brand new this season for our contestants, we have...
and I'm so pumped about this, June... sponsorship deals!
JUNE: It's truly incredible. After playing a certain number of rounds
our contestants will get an opportunity to sign with one of our sponsors - ENGIMO, HOLTOW, or ISEUL-T.
SCOTTY: Once they've signed, they'll earn fans for their sponsor to unlock exclusive rewards.

JUNE: It's turning out to be a jam-packed season! But Scotty... can you believe there's more?
SCOTTY: I believe it, and I know it!
There's Fortune Stadium, a new arena.
There's new weapons, and there's loads of new style items in the Battle Pass. Did I miss anything?
JUNE: Don't forget the new World Tour, which will feature more modes, extra events, and rewards.
Again, all headlined by our magnificent sponsors.
SCOTTY: Season 4 of THE FINALS starts now!
JUNE: It's showtime!
