SCOTTY: Look at this place, June! It's like a whole new level of style, isn't it?
JUNE: Yeah, Marcel's definitely left his mark.
The sponsors are front and center, and the race for the crown just went live.
SCOTTY: Hey, I'm all for it!
Contestants are rallying behind their sponsors and finding a sense of community.
JUNE: There's a flip side to that coin.
Everyone wants their sponsor wearing the crown, and tensions are brewing.
SCOTTY: It's all about the spotlight, June.
Marcel's got the show's AND the contestants' best interests at heart.
JUNE: I'll give you the first one. But as for the contestants,
we're already seeing groups forming.
And these things tend to escalate, Scotty.
