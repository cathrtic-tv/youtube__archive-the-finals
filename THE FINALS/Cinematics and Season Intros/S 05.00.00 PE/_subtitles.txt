SCOTTY: Can you believe it June? 
We've had one whole year of high-octane action, jaw-dropping plays, and absolute mayhem.
JUNE: It's been a wild ride for sure, Scotty. And, we're just getting started!
This season we are introducing-
SCOTTY: Clubs! Sorry June, I'm just too excited about this.
Finally, contestants can hit the arenas as part of a community. Whether you're building rivalries,
climbing the ranks, or just having fun, you can now leave your mark together!
JUNE: And what better way to build that legacy than with some new gadgets.
The brand new Lockbolt is looking particularly game-changing, locking the fight where it happens.
While the Gravity Vortex pulls everything and everyone into absolute chaos.
SCOTTY: And then there is the arsenal. The ShAK-50 is built for those close-quarters brawls, 
and that Cerberus shotgun, triple barrels loaded with dragon breath rounds.
It's pure devastation in your hands!
JUNE: And the best place to put all this new gear to the test? 
Bernal. This breathtaking new arena features low rooftops and wide courtyards, 
making it a playground for strategic ambushes and unexpected turnarounds.
SCOTTY: But, that's not all! Our World Tour is heating up with two new sponsors stepping in hoping to challenge
last season's returning fan-favorite, ISEUL-T. 
JUNE: This season is packed with excitement, 
including an incredible lineup of fresh cosmetics to keep you turning heads and dominating the arena in style.
SCOTTY: The stakes are higher, and the competition is fiercer than ever.
Let's make this anniversary season one to remember!
JUNE: Season 5 of THE FINALS starts now!
