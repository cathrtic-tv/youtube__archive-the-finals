[Door Slams]
JUNE: Well, thats the third door she's slammed this week.
SCOTTY: She's been trying to keep HydraQ out of the show forever.
And, now they're the official sponsor for the upcoming season.
JUNE: A little rivalry is always good for business, and no matter how many doors Sophia slams, Marcel's not changing his mind.
SCOTTY: Yeah but, no rollout, no announcement, and production said that HydraQ material and promo assets have just... vanished.
JUNE: What do you mean, "vanished"?
SCOTTY: The files, the campaign rollout, everything is gone!
Ten million MultiBucks says it's CNS.
Something brews on the horizon, remember?
JUNE: Ugh, this again.
SCOTTY: Yes, this again! We still don't have a sponsor for the next season. 
Tell me I'm wrong.
MARCEL: Sophia's been handled, the sponsor lineup isn't changing.
Now get back to work you two!
And Scotty?
SCOTTY: Sir?
MARCEL: Lay off the OSPUZE! This place reeks.
