SCOTTY: After a season kickoff that's been full of... technical surprises,  
we're happy to return to some festivities that will bring us some joyous ones.  
JUNE: Welcome to the eggstravaganza of Bunny Bash.  
SCOTTY: Teams will compete in Power Shift, and scramble to control the platform, and hop it to their base for the win.  
JUNE: Contestants will advance through our Easter circuit to earn exclusive spoils.  
SCOTTY: On top of that, we've got special contracts to celebrate the season.  
Trust me, these prizes are worth the hunt.  
JUNE: There will be plenty of action, so don't miss out!  
SCOTTY: And I'm glad we're back to the festivities that make THE FINALS the world's greatest game show!  
JUNE: Absolutely, Scotty!  
So to all our viewers at home, make sure to tune in.  
SCOTTY: Happy Bunny Bash!
