SCOTTY: Here we go again, gang.
ENGIMO is bringing back the Bunny Bash madness!
JUNE: Get ready to crack up! Teams will battle it out in Power Shift,
scrambling to control the platform and hop it home for the win.
SCOTTY: The ears are back, and the loadouts are ready.
Time to bunny up and get tactical!
JUNE: And don't forget to dig into these season's contracts!
The rewards are no yolk.
SCOTTY: Nothing says "greatest game show on Earth" like tactical bunny warfare!
JUNE: You got that right, Scotty.
Outfits fluffed, baskets loaded, let the Bunny Bash begin!
