SCOTTY: Strap in folks! We're taking the fight to our brand new Pop Drop Stadium!
JUNE: This is Heavy Hitters!
Ten contestants, two teams, one floating arena, where gravity's got beef.
SCOTTY: Loadouts are fixed and are all tuned for one thing, sending opponents flying.
JUNE: Opponents wont get eliminated by taking damage.
But, the lower their health the further they'll fly when they get hit.
SCOTTY: And, the best part? It's all brought to you by OSPUZE.
JUNE: Smash those contracts and grab the rewards while it's hot.
And, whatever you do, don't loose your footing.
