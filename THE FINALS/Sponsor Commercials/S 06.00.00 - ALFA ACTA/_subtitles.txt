SALES PERSON 1: [Cutting in] Absolutely. 
So, our Advanced Olfactory Targeting System is designed to track strong threatening odors

SALES PERSON 2: Now, that's clever.
Folks, you have the deal of a lifetime in front of you.
The M134 Minigun with the Carry Harness, the Rate Reducer, the Geofence System, and the Advanced Olfactory Targeting System.
If you call NOW, we'll throw all of them in for FREE!
Plus, the Welcoming Mat, and the Recoilless Blade.
Folks, this doesn't happen often, but I really feel this is a too good of a deal to sit out.
Now, let's pass the live feed over to Hector, so we can see this bad boy in action!
